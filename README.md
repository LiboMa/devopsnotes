# DevOps notes
This site is used for documenting DevOps related notes for me. During our daily Devops works, we will face so many issues, problems, and more ideas or concept for DevOps topics.
Thus, I would like to try to use my spare time to record all topics related. 

if you have any issues, concers, you could reach me with malibo8407(at)gmail.com. Thanks for reading
